        Rowel Jimenez is a Television, Radio, and Film major driven by a passion for scriptwriting and book creation. With skills in script coverage, creative writing, and proficiency in tools like Final Draft and Celtx, I bring stories to life visually through video editing (Premiere Pro, Photoshop) and excel in production management. Fluent in Spanish, I add cultural diversity to my projects and possess strong teamwork, leadership, and public speaking skills, further enhancing my role in the dynamic realm of media production. Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a Dominican writer who immerses myself in the horror genre during my free time. Whether exploring chilling narratives or enjoying quality time with my family, I embrace every opportunity for personal and creative growth.
